<h2>My Top Three (3) Series Of All Times Include</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Game Of Thrones</h3>
<p>“Game of Thrones offers the special indulgence 
    of vicarious, guilt-free barbarism,” says Freeman. 
    Life in every corner of Westeros is completely 
    un-politically correct good guys are killed, 
    bad guys gain power, women are raped and pawned about, 
    and people with “differences” are ridiculed and marginalized</p>
<h3>Prison Break</h3>
<p>This was such a great show! Prison Break is a heart pounding thriller 
that will keep you captivated throughout its entire run. The show is 
really smartly written where all of the cast and characters are given a 
chance to shine and they do...the entire cast is terrific!</p>
<h3>Breaking Bad</h3>
<p>Breaking Bad is widely regarded as one of the best TV dramas of 
the 21st century. Across five seasons and 62 episodes, 
it told a story of compelling criminals, quick-witted lawyers, 
and family conflict. It had some amazing, three-dimensional 
characters and consistently developed them throughout the show's run.</p>
